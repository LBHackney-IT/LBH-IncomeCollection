# Hackney Income Collection - Manage Arrears Frontend

This application provides the user interface for Income Collection officers to manage arrears of
various tenancy types.

Data is provided to this application via API calls to various services:

* [Income API](https://github.com/LBHackney-IT/lbh-income-api)
* [Tenancy API](https://github.com/LBHackney-IT/LBHTenancyAPI)

There are two continuously running services:
* [Production](https://managearrears.hackney.gov.uk/)
* [Staging](https://staging.managearrears.hackney.gov.uk/) - Basic Auth credentials are required.

# Authentication / Authorization

Users log in using their Hackney Google Account.

In order to access parts of the system, the user must be in one of the following groups:

* `managearrears-income-collection-read-write-production` - Rents Team
* `managearrears-leasehold-read-write-production` - Leasehold Team

To have an existing Hackney user added to the relevant group, contact one of the active maintainers on the contacts list below.

# Technology

This application is built using [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) and hosted in Heroku.

It has no persistence as it communicates directly with other APIs within Hackney.

It uses [Hackney Google SSO](https://github.com/LBHackney-IT/LBH-Google-auth) for authentication.

It uses [GOV.UK Notify](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/) to send SMS.
