# Infrastructure

The staging and production applications are hosted on Heroku. You will need to talk to Rashmi Shetty to get added as a collaborator to the apps.

## Static IP addresses

To communicate with the Hackney API, which is hosted on premises, we need whitelisted static IP addresses for the Heroku instances outbound traffic. They are provided by QuotaGuard Static as a Heroku addon, you can find them in the addon config.
